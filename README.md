### Prior to using github insure that you have a github username and login, you have been invited to the VA Aphasia Lab github group, and have the github desktop app.  

### How to effectively utilize github to push, pull, commit, and fetch projects.

### Pull the repository you wish to use:
- Open github desktop
- Click the button at the top left corner (under file, edit, view, etc) which likely says "current repoistory"
- Click the "add icon" and there will be a pop up that says "Clone Repository"
- If the repopistory you want to clone is visible under the GitHub.com tab, click this and save to your github folder of choice. 
  -If not, click URL and then copy and paste the link into the URL box and then click clone.
- You can now navigate to the folder that you cloned and open ane edit documents in this folder.
